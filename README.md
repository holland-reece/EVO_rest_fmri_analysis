# Lower Level Resting-state ROI Analysis
> seed-based correlation analysis for a region of interest
> resting-state functional data
> within-subjects analysis

# Higher Level Resting-state ROI Analysis
> resting-state functional data
> between-subjects comparison of lower level (ROI seed-based correlation) results
> within-subjects comparison from time 1 (pre-treatment) to time 2 (post-treatment)
> group-level comparison from time 1 (pre-treatment) to time 2 (post-treatment)
